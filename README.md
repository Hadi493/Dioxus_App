### Serving App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```sh
dx serve
# or
dx serve --port 8000
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```sh
dx serve --platform desktop
```

> ***Warning***: Monolithic but Majestic. Yeah, it’s just one main.rs file. Yeah, it’s not organized. But that’s because we’re building something from scratch, with soul.

> Full-stack mode loading... Until then, it’s just you, the UI, and some well-spent hours.
